“If you are focusing on what computer language to learn then you do not yet understand software engineering.”

"If all you want to do is write front-end web apps, then JavaScript may be your ticket. But for the rest of IT,
which includes leading-edge areas such as Artificial Intelligence, robotics, Big Data, Internet of Things,
Virtual Reality, scientific modelling and simulation, cloud computing, etc., JavaScript has no traction
against superior language competitors in each of those areas. Your JavaScript skills are not be easily 
transferrable. Thus, JavaScript is a colossal waste of time."
