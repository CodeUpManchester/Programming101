# Programming 101
I first attended CodeUp in July 2015 and got talking about quantum physics (as you do),
until Claire found me and asked why. When she found out I'd been a teacher her face lit
up and she asked if I could help guide the beginners through their first experience with
programming.

Just like that, Programming 101 was born, and has since become a successful and long-running 
workshop at CodeUp Manchester. This repository contains code, example programs and other
resources that have been used over the years and will probably grow over time.

I occasionally post out links to new resources on Twitter. Follow me: @dangerworm
